I also use `androidx.lifecycle.viewmodel` for saving data from [configuration changes](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes).

The app also support for [Dark theme](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-theming#0) and [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/)

This is the App:
